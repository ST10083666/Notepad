## Overview

## Purpose of the App 
Whether you're seeking to reduce stress, improve focus, or cultivate a deeper sense of inner peace, Still is your perfect companion on the journey to a calmer, more centered you. In relation to other similar apps on the market, Still is a competitive app as unlike other mindfulness application currently available on the market (such as Calm, HeadSpace and Forest), all features of the application are completely free, which allows for more people (who may not have the oppurtunity to use subscription based mindfulness applications) to access mindfulness content 
*(Jackson, 2022; Labib, 2021; Tartakovsky et al., 2022)*.

Still aims to bring peace, focus and inner peace to a broader consumer base, and to enable the public to have better mental health. 

## Design Considerations
In terms of the UI, we have chosen to go with a dark blue and yellow colour scheme with an occassional pop of colour.

We chose the dark blue colour as it creates a sense of calmness and peace for the user, which is sort of atmosphere that this application aims to provide for it's users. Yellow was used as it often associated with positive emotions, which is the sort of emotions that Still aims to invoke in it's users.  This can be seen in the screensot below

The occassional pop of colour has been added to ensure that the app is not extremely monochromatic to ensure that the user does not get bored of seeing the same 2 colours throughout the app- this can be seen in the image below:

## GitHub and GitHub Actions
GitHub is used to store and share code with others, while GitHub Actions provides a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform for developers to test their code and automate those tests 
*(GitHub, 2024)*.

Our team used GitHub to safely store our code, so team members have access to the most recent code and in the event of anything going wrong during development, it was guaranteed that we would have a working version to roll back to; furthermore, it allowed for collaboration as various developers could commit to different branches, while working on different features, ensuring that they do not get in each other's way during development
*(GitHub, 2024)*.

Our team used CircleCI and SonarQube along with GitHub Actions to automate checking our code for any vulnerablities and to test the code to ensure that it works not only on the developer's machines but on users' devices as well 
*(GitHub, 2024)*.

## In Depth Analyses of Serena-AI

Integrating Gemini AI as an Emotional Assistant

- In our Still app, we integrated Gemini AI to function as a personalized emotional assistant. This AI-powered companion, named Serina, helps users manage their emotions and provides personalized guidance on their mindfulness journey. Here's how Gemini AI enhances the app's capabilities:

- Emotion Detection: Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, Gemini AI interacts with users and interprets their emotional states based on the responses provided during conversations.

- Personalized Assistance: Once the emotional state is detected, Gemini AI customizes its responses to offer support. For instance, if a user feels anxious, Serina suggests calming exercises, soundscapes, or guided meditations tailored to relieve stress.

- Continuous Learning: Gemini AI continuously improves its interaction with the user by learning from previous emotional inputs. This makes it better suited to offer personalized recommendations over time.

- Real-Time Interaction: Users can engage with Serina in real time, receiving instant feedback and emotional support. This makes the interaction feel empathetic and human-like, enhancing the user's emotional well-being.

- Mindfulness Guidance: Beyond basic emotional support, Gemini AI serves as a guide through the mindfulness exercises within the app. Based on user moods and preferences, Serina suggests suitable meditation sessions, breathing exercises, or soothing soundscapes.

This integration makes Still unique, providing users with a constant emotional companion that adapts to their mental state, offering meaningful suggestions for maintaining balance and calm.

---

## Serenity API

In the Still app, we use an API to fetch calming songs and soundscapes that enhance the user's meditation and mindfulness experience. Hereâ€™s how it works:

**How the Song API Integration Works**

- API Request: The app sends a request to an external music API that provides access to a collection of songs designed for relaxation, mindfulness, and meditation. This request is made through HTTP protocols using GET requests, asking for specific types of music based on user preferences or emotional states detected by Gemini AI.
  
- Data Filtering: The API allows us to filter songs based on different criteria, such as:

- Mood-based categories: Relaxing, stress-relief, focus-enhancing, etc.
- Song genre: Nature sounds, instrumental, ambient, etc.
- Duration: Short tracks for quick meditations or longer ones for deep relaxation. These filters allow us to serve relevant songs that match the userâ€™s current mood or meditation session.
- Fetching Songs: Once the request is made, the API responds with song data, including:
- Track URL: The direct link to stream or download the song.
- Metadata: Information like song title, artist, genre, and duration.
- Audio Formats: Depending on the API, it may provide the song in different formats (e.g., MP3, WAV).
